Title of the Project

Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

Description

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning-based fake news detection system. It aims to analyze and classify online news articles as either real or fake, helping to mitigate the spread of misinformation.

About

The Fake News Detection System leverages machine learning techniques, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), to analyze text patterns and identify misinformation. The system processes news articles, extracts relevant features, and applies a trained model to determine the authenticity of the content. It enhances credibility assessment by automating the verification process and reducing reliance on manual fact-checking.

Features

Uses machine learning algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and deep learning models like LSTM and BERT.

Implements NLP techniques, including TF-IDF, word embeddings, and sentiment analysis.

Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting news articles and receiving classification results.

Supports dataset augmentation and real-time news analysis.

High accuracy and low false-positive rates through extensive model training and evaluation.
